# Economic Trends: The Story of Inflation (2000 to 2023)

This project explores how inflation changes over time and across regions using real data from the World Bank. It includes six distinct visualizations that together form a complete narrative about inflation’s global impact.

## Dataset
**Source:** World Bank Open Data  
**Indicator:** Consumer Price Inflation (FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG)  
**Years Covered:** 2000–2023  
**Countries:** United States, China, India, Germany, Brazil, South Africa  

## Tools
Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly Express)  
Kaggle Notebook environment  

## Visualizations
1. **Line Chart** — Global inflation trends (2000–2023)  
2. **Bar Chart** — Inflation by country (2023)  
3. **Dual Line Chart** — U.S. inflation vs wage growth  
4. **Choropleth Map** — Global inflation map (2023)  
5. **Stacked Area Chart** — Household spending breakdown  
6. **Scatter Plot** — Interest rate vs inflation  

## Design Approach
I used a consistent color scheme built around deep blue, warm orange, and soft gray for a calm yet dynamic feel.  
Each chart was chosen for a specific purpose: to show time, comparison, relationship, composition, or geography.  

## Insights
- Inflation tends to rise together globally during major economic shocks.  
- Developing economies often experience more volatility.  
- Wage growth doesn’t always match inflation, reducing real purchasing power.  
- Spending shifts toward essentials during periods of high inflation.
